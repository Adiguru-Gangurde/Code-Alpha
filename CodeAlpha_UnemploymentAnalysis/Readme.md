Unemployment Analysis with Python 📈
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the unemployment rate, particularly focusing on the period during the Covid-19 pandemic. By utilizing Python's data science ecosystem, I explored how the labor market shifted across different regions and timeframes to extract meaningful economic insights.

Key Objectives:
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and formatting time-series data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying regional disparities in unemployment.

Covid-19 Impact: Visualizing the sharp fluctuations during the 2020 lockdown.

Trend Analysis: Spotting seasonal patterns in the workforce.

Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.x

Libraries: * Pandas (Data manipulation)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)

NumPy (Numerical processing)

Jupyter Notebook (Development environment)

Data Analysis Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
The raw dataset contained some inconsistencies, such as extra spaces in column headers and date formats that were not machine-readable. I performed:

Column renaming for better accessibility.

Datetime conversion to enable chronological sorting.

Handling of null values to ensure statistical accuracy.

2. Visualization & Insights
The analysis includes several key visualizations:

Regional Bar Charts: Showcasing which states or regions maintained higher unemployment rates on average.

Time-Series Line Plots: Mapping the trajectory of the unemployment rate, highlighting the "spike" during the pandemic.

Heatmaps: Identifying seasonal trends where unemployment peaks at specific times of the year.

How to Run This Project
Clone the repository:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/unemployment-analysis-python.git
Install dependencies:

Bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Open the Notebook: Launch Jupyter Notebook and run the Unemployment_Analysis.ipynb file.

Conclusions
The analysis revealed that:

Certain regions experienced a much steeper increase in unemployment during the 2020 lockdown than others.

The recovery phase showed a staggered return to pre-pandemic levels depending on the local industrial focus.

Policy Recommendation: Targeted financial support for urban labor sectors may mitigate future sudden economic shocks.
